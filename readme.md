# Learn CSS Layout the pedantic way

Read the book here: [book.mixu.net/css/](http://book.mixu.net/css/)

## Contributing patches

Writing a patch should be easy: edit the markdown files under ./input/ and file a pull request; I'll handle the rest.

I didn't include the commits from prior to the release, because writing is a messy and painful process of revisions, deletions and rethinking things.

Taking a look at the commit history, I think I spent about five months on this piece of long form writing (~40 commits since January 2015), which is a lot less than typical.

# Directory structure

# License

This book is available for free, but what I've written remains mine.

Translations: as long as the result made is available for free (you can have ads) I welcome translations.

Other use: contact me; as long as your intentions are good I'd be happy to figure out something. I'm not looking to make money from the book but I don't want it to be republished without my permission.
